# Overview

Since I could not download my iPhone 11 Pro Max data and screen usage, I decided to replicate it. I created a R program called **Screen Time Creator** and gave it maximum for hours and the highest gigabyte I use in a day. I then created the **Data Cleaning** application to try to estimate how much of the data used comes from the wifi at my house.

# Development Environment

1. Visual Studio Code
2. R Programming Language
3. RStudio

I used R programming language. I used the RStudio IDE to write the code. I also used Visual Studio Code to do some checks and tests. I choose R since it's good with analytics and statistics. It was created for that purpose and it fits right into the scope of my program.
