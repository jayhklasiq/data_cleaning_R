# Overview

Since I could not download my iPhone 11 Pro Max data and screen usage, I decided to replicate it. I created a R program called **Screen Time Creator** and gave it maximum for hours and the highest gigabyte I use in a day. I then created the **Data Cleaning** application to try to estimate how much of the data used comes from the wifi at my house.

I wrote this application because I just got my phone back and I have tried to maintain a healthy screen time without it for over 10 months. Mimickly tracking how much data and screen time I potentially use is of great importance to me.

# Development Environment

1. Visual Studio Code
2. R Programming Language
3. RStudio

I used R programming language. I used the RStudio IDE to write the code. I also used Visual Studio Code to do some checks and tests. I choose R since it's good with analytics and statistics. It was created for that purpose and it fits right into the scope of my program.

# Future Work

- Might add a graph to show the pattern of my screentime usage on a graph. This might help me see if there are similarities in days of usage.
- I would love to add the original data from my phone. I might be able to do that with another programming language then generate a csv that the R program will use.
